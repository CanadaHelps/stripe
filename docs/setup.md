## Receipts

In addition to the receipts that CiviCRM can send, Stripe will send it's own receipt for payment by default.

If you wish to disable this under *Administer->CiviContribute->Stripe Settings* you can find a setting that allows you to disable Stripe from sending receipts:
* Allow Stripe to send a receipt for one-off payments?

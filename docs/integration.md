## Drupal Webform + Webform_civicrm

The Stripe extension works with Drupal Webform + Webform_civicrm.

For recurring payments make sure that:
1. You have either "Number of installments" or "Interval of installments" element on the same "page" as the payment.
2. The elements are either visible or hidden (hidden element) - do NOT select hidden (secure value) as it won't work.
